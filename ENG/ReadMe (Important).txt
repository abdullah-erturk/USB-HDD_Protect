USB/HHD Protect by mephistooo2 | TNCTR.com


WARNING:
The write-protection applied to the disk only works on the computer where the protection is applied. 
When you connect the protected disk to another computer, you will need to run the USBHDD_Protect.bat 
file again to activate the protection.

With this script file, you can easily protect all your disks, regardless of their NTFS/FAT/FAT32/exFAT/REFS 
partition structure, with just a few clicks.

This script file works on both portable USB flash drives and external hard drives, as well as local drives 
directly connected to your motherboard on your computer.

When you try to open the USBHDD_Protect_OpenSource.bat file, it will ask you for a password.

The default password is 1234 

However, if you want to set your own password and encrypt the code lines when the script file is opened 
with Notepad, you can use the USBHDD_Protect_Create.bat file to both set your own password and encrypt 
the script file.

The created file is completely encrypted, and when opened with Notepad, only Chinese characters will 
appear in the code lines. But when you double-click on the file, it will work properly.

Now, let's create a scenario :)

This scenario may be a scenario for you, but unfortunately, it happened to me.

Your child came home from school, and you were not at home, so they turned on your computer. 
They went to some silly game websites and infected your computer with a ransomware-type virus.

If you had set all your disks to read-only with this script file before handing over your computer 
to your child, the ransomware virus would not have been able to harm your computer.

The scenario I have written above actually happened to me :( 

WARNING:
This script file alone does not provide protection against ransomware-type viruses. 
Please take your own security measures for your important files.
